# Security

Thanks for helping make Jolution safe for everyone.

## Security

At Jolution, we take the security of our software products and services seriously. We are committed to ensuring the security of all our repositories, including the open source code managed through our GitHub organization, [Jolution](https://github.com/Jolution).

Although open source repositories are outside the scope of our bug bounty program and are not eligible for bounty rewards, we still value your contribution to our security efforts. If you discover a security vulnerability in any Jolution-owned repository, we ask you to report it to us following coordinated disclosure.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**
